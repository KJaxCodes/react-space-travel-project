# Space Travel Project Instructions

Welcome to the Space Travel project!

In the not-so-distant future, where technology has evolved by leaps and bounds, humanity has achieved the unimaginable: they have successfully transformed other planets in the solar system into habitable environments. Once the cradle of humanity, Earth had become a shadow of its former self due to centuries of neglect and environmental degradation. As a result, the focus of humankind had shifted beyond Earth's boundaries, and the key to their interplanetary exploration lay in a cutting-edge web application called "Space Travel."

The web application's users are commanders who will use it to evacuate humankind from the Earth. The web application is planned to empower users to list all spacecraft, view the details of a spacecraft, build a new one, and destroy the old one. But the capabilities of it continue beyond there. It is planned to enable users to view planets with the spacecraft on it and send spacecraft from one planet to another to transfer people.

## **Requirements**

- Design a welcoming **home page** that outlines the application's functionality.
- Develop a dedicated **spacecrafts page** (both the plural and the singular forms are "spacecraft", but the word "spacecrafts" is used intentionally to separate this page from the spacecraft page) that:
    - Displays all spacecraft and their details.
    - Provides navigation options for viewing specific spacecraft details, constructing new spacecraft, and decommissioning existing ones.
- Craft a detailed **spacecraft page** that presents comprehensive information about a particular spacecraft.
- Implement a **construction page** for spacecraft that:
    - Allows navigation back to the previous page.
    - Facilitates the creation of new spacecraft.
    - Shows errors for missing required fields (name, capacity, description).
- Create a **planets page** that:
    - Lists all planets and stationed spacecraft.
    - Enables planet selection for spacecraft dispatching, ensuring the destination differs from the current location.
- Integrate a loading component to manage API response times.
- Redirect all unmatched routes to the homepage.

## API

For this project, you are given a mock API in the starter code that stores the data in the local storage. You shouldn't touch the `/services/SpaceTravelMockApi.js` file, which mimics the back-end. Instead, you should use `/services/SpaceTravelApi.js`, which uses the API. In real life, you should create such a file that uses the `axios` library to use an API.

## Data Structures

**Response**

```jsx
{
  isError: <boolean>,
  data: <any>
}
```

**Planet**

```jsx
{
  id: <int>, // means data type is an integer
  name: <string>,
  currentPopulation: <int>,
  pictureUrl: [<string>] // means optional
}
```

Spacecraft

```jsx
{
  id: <string>,
  name: <string>,
  capacity: <int>,
  description: <string>,
  pictureUrl: [<string>],
  currentLocation: <int>
}
```

## Methods

| getPlanets | getPlanets (): Array<planet> | Fetches all planets. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| getSpacecrafts | getSpacecrafts (): Array<spacecraft> | Fetches all spacecraft. |
| getSpacecraftById | getSpacecraftById ({id: <string>}): <spacecraft> | Fetches a spacecraft by its ID. |
| buildSpacecraft | createSpacecraft ({name: <string>, capacity: <int>, description <string>, pictureUrl: [<string>]}): void (means pictureUrl is optional) | Builds a spacecraft on the Earth by generating an ID. |
|  destroySpacecraftById | destroySpacecraftById ({id: <int>}): void | Deletes a spacecraft by its ID. |
| sendSpacecraftToPlanet | sendSpacecraftToPlanet ({spacecraftId: <string>, targetPlanetId: <int>}): void | Transfer people by sending the spacecraft from its currently located planet to the target planet.
- If the capacity is greater than the current population of the currently located planet, it fills as much as it gets.
- Throws an error if the target planet is the same as the currently located planet.

You can access your starter code below. The folder structure ensures adherence to best practices:

- `components`: Contains components that are used as building blocks for pages.
- `context`: Contains providers that enable consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
- `pages`: Contains components that are used as a page. Pages are the components used to be rendered by a route.
- `routes`: Contains components that have route rendering logic.
- `services`: Contains services to reach external APIs.

This project employs CSS modules for component-specific styling and embraces the BEM methodology for naming conventions. Aspiring developers are encouraged to explore these practices further.
